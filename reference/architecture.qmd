title: "Data Architecture Reference"
---

## Purpose
- Document the technical architecture that enables HRL data collection, publication, ingestion, storage, analysis, and reporting.

## Layers to describe
- **Source systems** – Field/lab systems and static publication repositories such as EDI.
- **Ingestion & processing** – R/Python pipelines, containers, orchestration, and CI/CD services.
- **Storage & serving** – Cloud object storage, databases, catalogs, APIs, and SDKs.
- **Access & application** – Dashboards, decision-support tools, reporting pipelines, and user interfaces.

## Cross-cutting concerns
- Authentication/authorization, segmentation of sensitive data, and compliance with CARE agreements.
- Observability, logging, monitoring, and incident response procedures.
- Cost management, scalability, and sustainability over the eight-year program.

## Artifacts to include
- Architecture diagrams, sequence flows, infrastructure inventories, and dependency lists.
- References to backup/disaster-recovery strategies and large-file management plans.

## Ownership and evolution
- Central Data Team roles in maintaining the architecture and proposing enhancements.
- Change management process for approving new platforms, tools, or integrations via HRL governance bodies.
