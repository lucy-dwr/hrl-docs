title: "Glossary"

## Purpose
- Provide concise definitions so HRL partners use consistent terminology across agencies and workstreams.

## Terms to define
- **Data Producers** – Organizations responsible for collecting and publishing source data under approved protocols.
- **Central Data Team** – Interagency engineers/scientists who run ingestion, storage, serving, and shared tooling.
- **Synthesis Teams** – Analysts generating models, indicators, and reports from curated datasets.
- **Static Publication** – GitHub + EDI workflow for releasing citable datasets with metadata and DOIs.
- **Ingestion and Standardization** – Pipelines that harmonize datasets, enforce schemas, and track provenance.
- **Storage and Serving** – Infrastructure and catalogs that keep curated datasets durable and accessible.
- **Analysis and Synthesis** – Reproducible modeling/analysis projects that produce derived products.
- **Reporting and Communication** – Annual, triennial, and final reports derived from lifecycle outputs.
- Additional vocabulary (FAIR, CARE, DOI, EML, data catalog, semantic versioning, etc.) with cross-links to standards pages.

## Maintenance
- Note owners for approving new terms or edits and the cadence for reviewing glossary updates.
- Describe how glossary entries will be cross-linked throughout the site and in quickstarts.
