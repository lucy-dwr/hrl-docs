title: "Static Publication"
---

## Purpose
- Describe how HRL releases cleaned, versioned datasets through GitHub repositories and EDI.
- Reinforce that static datasets must be reproducible, citable, and accompanied by complete metadata.

## Workflow components
- Repository setup aligned with the HRL Style & Development Guide (structure, naming, README, licensing).
- Data cleaning and QA scripts, automation, and continuous integration checks prior to release.
- Metadata authoring (EML, data dictionaries, plain-language summaries, provenance statements).
- Submission steps for EDI, DOI minting, and coordination with curators.

## Publication package checklist
- Required files in open formats plus metadata XML/JSON, README, QA logs, and changelog/NEWS entries.
- Documentation of Tribal agreements or special access notes when applicable.
- Sign-off process (project team review, approval routing, notification to the Central Data Team).

## Outputs and handoffs
- DOI-minted dataset and tagged GitHub release with reproducible code.
- Communication package for the ingestion team (release notes, schema summary, contact info).
- Guidance for transferring large/complex files directly to the Central Data Team when needed.
