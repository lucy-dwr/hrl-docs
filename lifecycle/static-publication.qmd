- Data Producers finalize cleaned datasets into tidy, version-controlled releases with DOIs, complete metadata, and links to source code that follows the conventions described in the [HRL Style and Development Guide](../standards/style-dev-guide.qmd).
- Datasets are published to the [Environmental Data Initiative (EDI)](https://edirepository.org) in open, non-proprietary formats with complete provenance metadata and open licenses.
- Releases posted to GitHub and EDI become the trusted inputs for data ingestion, cataloging, and downstream analyses.

**Description:**  

In the static publication step, **Data Producers finalize cleaned datasets into tidy, versioned data packages;** run automated quality control checks that ensure that data meet HRL and EDI publication standards; and publish data packages through HRL GitHub repositories and [EDI](https://edirepository.org) with complete metadata and DOIs. Metadata are assembled using the tools in the `hrlpub` R package, which wrap [`EMLassemblyline`](https://ediorg.github.io/EMLassemblyline/index.html) and [EDI APIs](https://edirepository.org/resources/rest-api) to ensure that metadata and data packages pass EDI's evaluation checks.

_Note: HRL Data Producers are expected to publish most datasets to EDI. However, very large or complex datasets—such as high-resolution imagery collections, climate model outputs, or large geospatial files—may exceed EDI’s size and storage constraints. These datasets will be hosted and published by the Central Data Team using HRL program infrastructure, with EDI metadata records and landing pages cross-linking to the hosted assets when appropriate._

**Outcome:**  

The output of this data lifecycle step is a **citable, reproducible data package released on EDI** in open formats with complete metadata, structured data dictionaries, provenance notes, quality control logs, and source code pinned to an immutable GitHub release. Metadata are written in [Ecological Metadata Language (EML)](https://eml.ecoinformatics.org) to ensure machine readability, human readability, and interoperability with other data systems and to facilitate discovery, reuse, and integration with HRL data catalogs and search tools.

**Benefit:**  

Publishing static datasets creates **trusted, FAIR- and CARE-aligned data assets** that downstream ingestion, cataloging, and analysis workflows can rely on, while also making HRL data discoverable, transparent, and reusable by partners, collaborators, and the public.

## Workflow steps

For each dataset publication, Data Producers should complete the steps provided in the quickstart guide on [publishing a static dataset to EDI](../quickstart/publish-to-edi.qmd) and previewed below. 

- Create the GitHub repository scaffolding
- Connect and process data including reproducible quality control
- Prepare metadata templates and EML document
- Peer review of data package
- Publich data package on EDI

## Publication package checklist

### What goes to EDI

- Tidy data files in open, non-proprietary formats (e.g., CSV, Parquet, GeoJSON) with a clear version identifier
- Complete EML metadata for the release, including:
  - Data dictionaries (attributes files)
  - Abstract describing the dataset, scope, and intended use
  - Methods including quality control report or summary
  - Personnel and contact information
  - License statement
  - Temporal and geographic coverage
  - Provenance (source DOIs, commit hash of the tagged release, parameters, external datasets)
- Documentation of data sharing agreements, use constraints, access notes, or sensitive-data handling instructions (including Tribal agreements when applicable)

### What stays in the GitHub repository

- Tagged GitHub release with the exact code, configuration, parameters, and dependencies used to produce the published data
- Release notes in a `NEWS` entry for the tagged version that summarize changes since the prior release, if relevant
- Continuous integration workflows validating data quality and code functionality
- Relevant reports or Standard Operating Protocol documents

## Outputs and handoffs

Publishing data following the HRL static publication workflow results in the following reproducible, well-documented outputs:

- A versioned dataset published on EDI with complete EML metadata and a DOI
- A tagged GitHub release containing the exact code, configuration, and parameters used to produce the published data, linked in the EML provenance

After publishing data on EDI, Data Producers should notify the Central Data Team and provide a link to the EDI landing page and GitHub release. The Central Data Team will then ingest the dataset into HRL data catalogs and downstream analysis pipelines as appropriate.

If datasets are potentially too large or complex to publish on EDI, Data Producers should instead work directly with the Central Data Team on hosting and publication plans.
