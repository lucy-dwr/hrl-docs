title: "Ingestion and Standardization"
---

## Purpose
- Explain how the Central Data Team harvests HRL and external datasets and converts them into interoperable program assets.
- Show how ingestion supports timely analysis, catalog updates, and downstream reporting.

## Pipeline requirements
- Version-controlled R/Python pipelines with containers, automation, and CI/CD checks.
- Provenance capture (source DOI, source version, commit hashes, processing parameters).
- Ability to ingest static publication releases and synthesis products.

## Harmonization standards
- Schema alignment (column names, units, data types) and tidy data expectations.
- Controlled vocabularies for species, habitats, locations, and QA codes.
- Missing-value conventions and spatial reference requirements.

## Quality management
- Automated schema validation, cross-dataset consistency checks, and program-level gates (row counts, uniqueness, bounding boxes).
- Error logging stored with datasets plus remediation workflow.

## Infrastructure and access
- Cloud-native deployment guidance, container registries, and scheduling/orchestration patterns.
- Flagging and routing sensitive datasets for special handling during storage and serving.
- Deliverables for downstream teams (harmonized dataset, machine-readable schema, QA reports).
