title: "Storage and Serving"
---

## Objectives
- Maintain curated datasets securely while keeping them discoverable for synthesis teams and the public.
- Document durability, backup, and segregation strategies for diverse data types.

## Architecture topics
- Preferred storage formats (Parquet, GeoParquet, CSV, GeoPackage, GeoTIFF) and redundancy requirements.
- Backup/restore patterns, lifecycle policies, and management of large/object datasets.
- Segregation of sensitive or embargoed data with appropriate authentication and authorization controls.

## Access and discovery
- HRL data catalog expectations (search facets, spatial/temporal filters, metadata sync).
- Programmatic access paths (APIs, SQL/query services, SDKs/helper functions) and bulk download options.
- Surfacing version history, changelog notices, and deprecation warnings.

## Metadata and documentation
- Keeping machine-readable metadata, READMEs, and DOIs synchronized with repository releases.
- Linking catalog entries back to provenance captured during ingestion and publication.

## Monitoring and notifications
- Availability/performance monitoring, logging, and alerting.
- Communication plans when curated datasets update or access methods change.
