title: "Data collection"
---

## Objectives
- Define what counts as collection (field, lab, and model outputs) across HRL hypotheses.
- Ensure data type documentation and approved protocols appear in system-level science plans.
- Emphasize real-time metadata capture and field QA/QC expectations.

## Topics to cover
- Inventory of common data types plus process for proposing new methods.
- Required metadata elements (who, when, where, how, equipment, calibration routines).
- Field QA/QC practices such as calibration logs, duplicates, controls, and environmental notes.
- Roles for Data Producers and oversight points for the HRL Science Committee/Data Governance Group.

## Inputs and outputs
- Inputs: approved protocols, instrumentation settings, sampling designs, training materials.
- Outputs: raw data files, field forms, preliminary QA reports ready for static publication workflows.

## Decision points and governance
- Explain when protocol updates need approval and how to document that decision.
- Note notification pathways back to the Central Data Team following collection events.
- Describe how sensitive/Tribal data agreements are recorded at the point of collection.
