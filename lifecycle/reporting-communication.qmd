title: "Reporting and Communication"
---

## Purpose
- Explain how HRL communicates findings through annual activity reports, triennial synthesis products, and the final Ecological Outcomes and Analysis report.
- Connect lifecycle outputs to adaptive management decisions and public accountability.

## Reporting cadence
- Annual reports summarizing data collection progress, QA status, and early findings.
- Triennial synthesis reports that integrate results across hypotheses, tributaries, and habitats.
- Final program-scale outcomes assessment that informs continuation, modification, or termination decisions.

## Content planning
- Sections on ecological findings, uncertainties, decision-support tools, and resource needs.
- Integration of graphics/dashboards supported by storage-serving systems and analysis outputs.
- Treatment of sensitive/Tribal information consistent with CARE-aligned agreements.

## Workflow and approvals
- Roles for Synthesis Teams (analytical narratives), Central Data Team (figures, data services), and the HRL Science Committee (review/prioritization).
- Timelines for locking datasets, drafting chapters, review cycles, and public release.

## Dissemination and feedback
- Channels for sharing with agencies, Tribes, and the public (website updates, briefings, data catalog highlights).
- Mechanisms for collecting feedback that feeds back into protocols, standards, and future lifecycle iterations.
