title: "HRL Data Lifecycle Overview"
---

## Purpose of this page
- Introduce the HRL-specific lifecycle described in the Data Governance and Management Plan and how it supports transparent, reproducible science.
- Show how responsibilities shift among Data Producers, the Central Data Team, Synthesis Teams, and the HRL Science Committee.

## Lifecycle phases at a glance
- [Collection](collection.qmd) – Document approved protocols, metadata capture, and field QA/QC practices.
- [Static Publication](static-publication.qmd) – Publish cleaned datasets with metadata packages and DOIs through the HRL GitHub + EDI workflow.
- [Ingestion & Standardization](ingestion-standardization.qmd) – Harmonize static releases, align schemas/vocabularies, and capture provenance.
- [Storage & Serving](storage-serving.qmd) – Keep curated datasets durable, discoverable, and accessible via catalogs, APIs, and SDKs.
- [Analysis & Synthesis](analysis-synthesis.qmd) – Run reproducible analyses, create indicators, and return derived products for curation.
- [Reporting & Communication](reporting-communication.qmd) – Translate findings into annual and triennial products that guide adaptive management.

## Governance touchpoints to highlight
- Describe Science Committee checkpoints (science plan approval, prioritization, resourcing) tied to each phase.
- Clarify accountability for Data Producers, Central Data Team engineers, and Synthesis Teams.
- Note how sensitive/Tribal data agreements constrain movement through the lifecycle.

## How to use this section
- Provide narrative context for newcomers and link to quickstarts, standards, and reference diagrams.
- Summarize where SOPs, templates, and decision logs live for each lifecycle phase.
- Capture updates as HRL policies evolve over the eight-year program.
