This structure defines who does what in data collection, publication, and analysis; how data move through the program; and how decisions are made at each stage of the HRL data lifecycle.\nThe governance model balances the independence of data producers with shared program-wide standards, centralized data engineering capacity, and strategic oversight from the HRL Science Committee.\nFor a description of how data move from collection to analysis and reporting, see the HRL Data Lifecycle section of this site.",
