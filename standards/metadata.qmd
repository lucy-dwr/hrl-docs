title: "Metadata standards"
---

## Purpose
- Ensure every HRL dataset is accompanied by complete, machine-readable metadata aligned with FAIR and CARE commitments.

## Metadata package components
- Plain-language summaries, contacts, temporal/spatial coverage, methods, QA/QC descriptions, and licensing.
- Data dictionaries describing variables, units, types, allowed values, and file relationships.

## Standards to cite
- Ecological Metadata Language (EML) for EDI submissions, plus JSON/CSV metadata for curated datasets and catalog entries.
- Alignment with HRL schema/vocabulary registries and provenance expectations.

## Authoring workflow
- Capture metadata at collection, refine during static publication, verify during ingestion/storage, and keep catalog entries synchronized.
- Tools/templates (Quarto forms, scripts) for building metadata packages efficiently.

## Validation and stewardship
- Automated linting/validation, metadata review gates, and linkage to QA/QC evidence.
- Procedures for updating metadata when datasets change versions, including changelog references.

## Sensitive data considerations
- Document CARE-aligned restrictions, access notes, and embargo policies directly in metadata records.
