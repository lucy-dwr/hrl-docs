title: "Reproducible Science"
---

## Purpose
- Document HRL-wide expectations for transparent, reproducible coding, data engineering, and analytical practices.

## Core commitments
- Version-controlled R/Python workflows that follow the HRL Style & Development Guide.
- Continuous integration/testing for data publication, ingestion, and synthesis repositories.
- Comprehensive documentation of inputs, assumptions, QA steps, and outputs.

## Practices to outline
- Repository boilerplate (README, CONTRIBUTING, LICENSE, NEWS) plus data dictionaries and metadata files.
- Use of Quarto for report generation, parameterized workflows, and scripted pipelines.
- Provenance tracking (dataset DOIs, commit hashes, release tags) and alignment with semantic versioning.

## Review and support mechanisms
- Peer/code review expectations, Central Data Team consultation routes, and issue tracking norms.
- Storage of validation artifacts (QA logs, reproduction reports) alongside datasets and releases.

## Resources
- Pointers to quickstarts, templates, office hours, and other support channels that help teams meet reproducibility goals.
