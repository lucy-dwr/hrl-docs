## Purpose
- Summarize HRL Science Committee Charter commitments that anchor this documentation hub.
- Provide a reference map to detailed lifecycle, standards, and quickstart guidance.

## Charter commitments to detail
- **Standards for data collection** – agreed protocols, thorough documentation, and comparable methods across HRL parties.
- **Standards for data management** – machine-readable formats, QA/QC evidence, provenance, and CARE-aligned handling of sensitive/Tribal data.
- **Standards for data access** – publication in open repositories and services with machine-readable metadata and programmatic access.
- **Standards for integration and analysis** – structured, reproducible workflows with transparent diagnostics and publishable derived products.

## Program-wide priorities
- **Efficiency and responsiveness** – modular, documented workflows that support annual/triennial reporting and rapid onboarding.
- **Scalable, future-proof infrastructure** – cloud-native, open, standards-based systems that evolve with tools and data volume.
- **Program-wide learning** – shared templates, training curricula, and professional development for HRL parties.

## How to use this page
- Link each commitment to relevant lifecycle and standards pages where detailed procedures live.
- Capture governance updates when the Science Committee revises commitments or adds new requirements.
- Offer pointers to decision logs or change histories for transparency.
