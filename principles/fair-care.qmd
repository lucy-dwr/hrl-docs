title: "FAIR and CARE Principles"
---

## Purpose
- Translate HRL commitments to FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and CARE (Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, Ethics) into actionable expectations.
- Show how these principles guide decisions from collection through reporting.

## FAIR focus areas
- **Findable** – DOIs, catalog registration, persistent identifiers, and keyword-rich metadata.
- **Accessible** – Open repositories (EDI, APIs) plus transparent documentation of any access restrictions.
- **Interoperable** – Shared schemas, controlled vocabularies, tidy data structures, and spatial reference standards.
- **Reusable** – Provenance, licensing, QA statements, and citation instructions for downstream analyses.

## CARE considerations
- Formal agreements with Tribes detailing permitted uses, review processes, and benefit-sharing.
- Flagging sensitive/sovereignty-linked data at collection, publication, and ingestion.
- Respectful attribution and communication practices in synthesis and reporting outputs.

## Implementation checklist
- Responsibilities for Data Producers vs. Central Data Team (e.g., metadata authorship, access controls, catalog notes).
- Templates for capturing CARE requirements and linking them to dataset metadata.
- Evidence to archive (agreements, approvals, restriction notes) so compliance can be audited.
