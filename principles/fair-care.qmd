title: "FAIR and CARE principles"
---

**The HRL Science Program commits to creating data assets that are open, reusable, and respectful of Tribal sovereignty and community priorities.** The FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and CARE (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics) frameworks serve as the shared language for those commitments. This page translates the FAIR and CARE frameworks into practical expectations that [Data Producers, the Central Data Team, and Synthesis Teams](../about/governance-roles.qmd) can apply across every phase of the [HRL Data Lifecycle](../lifecycle/overview.qmd).

## FAIR and CARE at a glance

### FAIR

The [FAIR Guiding Principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) for scientific data management and stewardship were [published in 2016](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) to improve the ability of both humans and machines to find, access, interoperate, and reuse scientific data.

<ul>
<li>Register DOIs and expose them through the HRL data catalog and common repositories.</li>

<li>Where relevant, document authentication steps and contact points and maintain access notes, embargoes with renewal dates, and Tribal review requirements.</li>

### CARE

The [CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance](https://www.gida-global.org/care) were [published in 2020](https://datascience.codata.org/articles/dsj-2020-043) to ensure that scientific data practices respect Indigenous sovereignty and promote equitable benefits for Indigenous Peoples and local communities. The CARE Principles are motivated by the recognition that data about Indigenous Peoples and collected by them are frequently suppressed, stolen, misused, and mishandled in ways that perpetuate harm and extractive relationships.

## Importance of FAIR and CARE

- **FAIR ensures scientific utility.** Metadata rigor, persistent identifiers, and open formats allow HRL data to be discovered, cited, and reused across agencies and the broader research community.
- **CARE ensures ethical science and reciprocity.** Sensitive observations, Indigenous Knowledge, and Tribal and community agreements are honored in metadata, management, access controls, and communications so that benefits and decision-making authority remain with source communities in order to redress harmful histories and counteract extractive tendencies that persist in public agencies and Western science.
- **Both frameworks travel together.** Collection protocols, static publication packages, ingestion pipelines, and synthesis reports must document how FAIR and CARE requirements were met and where exceptions were negotiated.

## Implementation references

Use this table as a quick crosswalk for what FAIR and CARE look like at each point in the HRL data lifecycle and which artifacts demonstrate that the requirements were addressed. **Program-level resources for HRL parties to develop overarching knowledge, capacity, and practices for upholding FAIR and CARE commitments will be developed by the HRL Science Committee and the Central Data Team.**
