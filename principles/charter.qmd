title: "Science charter commitments"
---

The [HRL Science Committee Charter](https://resources.ca.gov/-/media/CNRA-Website/Files/Initiatives/Support-Healthy-Rivers-and-Landscape/VASciProgramDraftCharter.pdf), particularly Appendix D, describes the commitments that guide data collection, publication, and analysis activities under the [HRL Science Program](https://resources.ca.gov/Initiatives/Voluntary-Agreements-Page/Science). This page summarizes those commitments so that HRL Program partners understand the expectations that underpin the rest of this documentation hub. Use it as a quick refresher before diving into detailed guidance on the data lifecycle, standards, or common activities.

## Core charter commitments

The HRL Science Committee charter expresses principles that support open, reproducible, ethical science. The principles are operationalized through common practices across the full data lifecycle.

### Data collection

- HRL parties collect data using **approved protocols** documented in system-level science plans.
- Data Producers capture **complete metadata** at the point of collection, including metadata describing who collected the data, when and where the data were collected, equipment settings, and calibration routines.
- **Field quality assurance and quality control activities** (e.g., duplicates, blanks, environmental notes, and calibration logs) are recorded and carried forward into publication packages.
- **Sensitive or Tribal sovereignty-linked observations** are identified early and handled under agreements co-developed with Tribes and partner entities.

### Data management

- Datasets are stored in **machine-readable, non-proprietary formats** and structured according to [**tidy data principles**](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html) where practical.
- **Quality control steps** are scripted, version-controlled, and documented through validation logs.
- **Provenance is preserved** from raw inputs through static data publication, ingestion, and synthesis; every workflow records source DOIs, code versions, and processing parameters.
- **CARE-aligned data handling requirements** are embedded in metadata, storage locations, and access controls.

### Data access

- Static HRL **datasets receive DOIs** (e.g., via EDI) and **are discoverable** through the HRL data catalog, search, and APIs.
- **Metadata packages** provide plain-language summaries, schema information, keywords, and access notes.
- **Programmatic access routes** (bulk download, APIs, SDKs) are maintained so analysts and partners can use the data without manual, one-off transfers.

### Integration and analysis

- All analyses are implemented through **structured R or Python workflows** managed in HRL **GitHub repositories** that follow the [HRL Style and Development Guide](../standards/style-dev-guide.qmd).
- **Continuous integration** tests verify that code runs, schemas match expectations, and outputs reproduce.
- Derived synthesis datasets, indicators, and models are **versioned, documented, and returned to the Central Data Team** for curation and publication.
- Analytical workflows include **diagnostics, uncertainty statements, and clear linkage to input datasets** so results can be validated and reused.

## Program-wide priorities

HRL data governance and management emphasizes three cross-cutting priorities that help HRL meet its commitments.

### Efficiency and responsiveness

- **Modular pipelines and reusable templates** reduce duplication and support repeatable annual and triennial reporting.
- **Thorough documentation and coding standards** enable rapid onboarding of new collaborators and contractors and coherence of data and code products across the entire program.
- **Feedback loops** between Data Producers, the Central Data Team, and Synthesis Teams surface issues quickly, allow the data and analysis enterprise to evolve to meet program needs, and inform adaptive management decisions.

### Scalable, future-proof infrastructure

- **Cloud-native, open, and standards-based technologies** allow HRL to ingest increasing data volumes and adopt new tools as needed.
- **Storage, compute, and orchestration platforms** are selected for durability and portability over the eight-year program horizon.
- **Large or complex datasets** (e.g., imagery, LiDAR, and modeling outputs) are handled with architectures that support efficient storage, retrieval, and processing.

### Program-wide learning

- Shared templates, training curricula, office hours, and documentation keep **practices aligned across agencies.**
- **Lessons from synthesis and reporting cycles** feed updates into protocols, standards, and governance decisions.
- **Knowledge is captured** in repositories, catalogs, and documentation sites so it persists beyond individual personnel changes.
