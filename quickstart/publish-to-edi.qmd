title: "Publish a static dataset to EDI"
---

## Goal
- Provide a repeatable recipe for preparing, documenting, and releasing HRL datasets through the GitHub + EDI workflow.

## Before you start
- Confirm approved protocols, quality-controlled data, and HRL GitHub repository scaffolding are in place.
- Gather metadata inputs (contacts, methods, spatial/temporal coverage, keywords, Tribal agreements).

## Step-by-step outline
- Scaffold a repository from the HRL publication template, configure dependencies, and set up CI.
- Script data cleaning, QA, and validation; capture logs and evidence in the repo.
- Author EML metadata, data dictionaries, README, and provenance notes.
- Run automated checks, perform peer review, and tag a release candidate.
- Submit the package to EDI, address curator feedback, and mint a DOI.
- Announce the release to the Central Data Team with schema highlights and contact info.

## Deliverables
- DOI-linked dataset in open formats plus metadata artifacts, QA logs, and changelog entries.
- Communication template for ingestion and catalog updates.

## Support
- Point to metadata leads, Central Data Team contacts, and office hours for troubleshooting publication steps.
