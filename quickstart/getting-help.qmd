## When to reach out
- During onboarding, when interpreting standards, troubleshooting pipelines, or handling sensitive/Tribal data questions.
- Any time timelines or reporting commitments are at risk because of data or tooling blockers.

## Primary support channels
- Central Data Team for data engineering, ingestion, catalog, and infrastructure topics.
- Metadata/FAIR-CARE leads for publication, documentation, and access control questions.
- HRL Science Committee liaisons or governance representatives for prioritization and policy issues.

## What to prepare
- Concise problem statement, relevant repository links, dataset DOIs/versions, and log files/screenshots.
- Summary of actions already taken and decision deadlines to inform triage.

## Feedback and learning loops
- Document resolved issues in GitHub or knowledge bases so others can reference them.
- Capture suggestions for improving templates, standards, or training and route them to the Central Data Team.

## Escalation
- Criteria for elevating issues to HRL program leadership or the Science Committee when standards changes or additional resources are required.
