title: "Welcome to the HRL Documentation Hub"
---

The [Healthy Rivers and Landscapes program](https://resources.ca.gov/Initiatives/Voluntary-Agreements-Page) (HRL) is an eight-year interagency effort to restore aquatic habitat, provide environmental flows, and adaptively manage ecosystems in the Sacramento River watershed and the Bay-Delta estuary. HRL aims to improve ecological conditions for native fish populations and is proposed as part of the implementation program for the State Water Resources Control Board’s Bay-Delta Water Quality Control Plan.

HRL implementation and adaptive management are guided by a comprehensive [Science Program](https://resources.ca.gov/Initiatives/Voluntary-Agreements-Page/Science) that investigates how coordinated restoration and environmental flows influence ecological processes and native aquatic species from Sacramento tributary systems to the Bay-Delta estuary. The program is governed by an HRL [Science Committee](https://resources.ca.gov/-/media/CNRA-Website/Files/Initiatives/Support-Healthy-Rivers-and-Landscape/VASciProgramDraftCharter.pdf) composed of representatives from HRL signatory entities and technical experts.

This website serves as the central hub for documentation, standards, and learning materials that support the data engineering and data science components of the HRL Science Program.

## Purpose of This Site

This documentation website provides:

-   **Data governance and data management standards**\
-   **Core program-wide commitments** related to reproducible science, FAIR and CARE principles, metadata, and versioning\
-   **High-level, conceptual workflows** for data publication, ingestion, storage, and synthesis\
-   **Guidance and onboarding materials** for data producers, analysts, and synthesis teams\
-   **Links to templates, examples, tools, and other HRL resources** for synthesis science, communication, and adaptive management

This site focuses on high-level program governance, structures, and workflows. Technical implementations, reproducible templates, and workflow code live in companion HRL GitHub repositories and are linked throughout this documentation hub.

## HRL’s Data System: Overview

To support transparent, reproducible science across diverse agencies and projects, HRL follows a structured, program-specific **data lifecycle**:

1.  **Collection** – Standardized data collection protocols, field metadata collection, and quality assurance
2.  **Static Publication** – Cleaned, versioned, citable datasets published in trusted repositories, in alignment with FAIR and CARE principles
3.  **Ingestion and Standardization** – Integration into HRL’s curated, interoperable data system
4.  **Storage and Serving** – Durable, analysis-ready datasets and catalogs with well-documented and user-friendly access mechanisms
5.  **Analysis and Synthesis** – Reproducible workflows, synthesis products, and reporting cycles
6.  **Reporting and Communication** – Interactive dashboards, reports, and decision support tools for science commmunication and adaptive management

These phases are supported by **defined roles**:

-   **Data Producers** – Collect, document, and publish datasets
-   **Central Data Team** – Standardize, steward, and serve program data, plus provide technical leadership in application development
-   **Synthesis Teams** – Analyze curated data and generate synthesis outputs to investigate Science Program hypotheses
-   **HRL Science Committee** – Oversee, prioritize, and guide the Science Program

This site explains what each phase entails and how participants contribute.

## Getting Started

If you are new to the HRL Science Program, particularly the data engineering and data science enterprise, start with:

-   **About HRL** – Program overview, governance structure, and roles
-   **Program Commitments** – FAIR, CARE, metadata, reproducibility standards
-   **Data Governance** – How data move through HRL’s lifecycle
-   **Quickstarts** – Step-by-step guides to common tasks (e.g., publishing static datasets and metadata on EDI)

As HRL evolves, keystone science documents such as the HRL Science Plan will also be made available as interactive web documents.
