    "text": "The Healthy Rivers and Landscapes program (HRL) is an eight-year interagency effort to restore aquatic habitat, provide environmental flows, and adaptively manage ecosystems in the Sacramento River watershed and the Bay-Delta estuary. HRL aims to improve ecological conditions for native fish populations and is proposed as part of the implementation program for the State Water Resources Control Board’s Bay-Delta Water Quality Control Plan.\nHRL implementation and adaptive management are guided by a comprehensive Science Program that investigates how coordinated restoration and environmental flows influence ecological processes and native aquatic species from Sacramento tributary systems to the Bay-Delta estuary. The program is governed by an HRL Science Committee composed of representatives from HRL signatory entities and technical experts.\nThis website serves as the central hub for documentation, standards, and learning materials that support the data engineering and data science components of the HRL Science Program.",

    "text": "HRL’s Data System: Overview\nTo support transparent, reproducible science across diverse agencies and projects, HRL follows a structured, program-specific data lifecycle:\n\nCollection – Standardized data collection protocols, field metadata collection, and quality assurance\nStatic Publication – Cleaned, versioned, citable datasets published in trusted repositories, in alignment with FAIR and CARE principles\nIngestion and Standardization – Integration into HRL’s curated, interoperable data system\nStorage and Serving – Durable, analysis-ready datasets and catalogs with well-documented and user-friendly access mechanisms\nAnalysis and Synthesis – Reproducible workflows, synthesis products, and reporting cycles\nReporting and Communication – Interactive dashboards, reports, and decision support tools for science commmunication and adaptive management\n\nThese phases are supported by defined roles:\n\nData Producers – Collect, document, and publish datasets\nCentral Data Team – Standardize, steward, and serve program data, plus provide technical leadership in application development\nSynthesis Teams – Analyze curated data and generate synthesis outputs to investigate Science Program hypotheses\nHRL Science Committee – Oversee, prioritize, and guide the Science Program\n\nThis site explains what each phase entails and how participants contribute.",
