title: "Data Governance and Roles"
---

The HRL Science Program relies on a Science Committee, which is a distributed, multi-agency governance structure designed to support high-quality, management-relevant science  across the Sacramento River watershed and Bay-Delta estuary over the program’s eight-year duration. Part of the HRL Science Committee's governance structure addresses data governance---defining who does what in data collection, publication, and analysis; how data move through the program; and how decisions are made at each stage of the HRL data lifecycle.

### Defining Data Governance
Data governance is a set of processes that ensures that data assets are formally managed throughout an enterprise. A data governance model establishes authority and management and decision-making parameters related to the data produced or managed by the enterprise.

_Definition drawn from the [National Institute of Standards and Technology]((https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/data_governance))._
:::

The HRL data governance model balances the independence of Data Producers with shared program-wide standards, centralized data engineering capacity, and strategic oversight from the HRL Science Committee.

For a description of how data move from collection to analysis and reporting, see the **[HRL Data Lifecycle](../lifecycle/overview.qmd)** section of this site.

## Why Governance Matters

HRL is evaluating dozens of hypotheses across multiple spatial scales, habitat types, and time periods. The HRL Science Program will last at least eight years. The complexity and duration of this collaborative research program necessitates:

- Clear accountability for data collection and stewardship  
- Documented standards for data collection, management, publication, and analysis  
- Trusted data repositories and open, reproducible workflows for cleaning, publishing, and synthesizing data
- Feedback loops that allow HRL to learn and adapt  
- Transparent decision-making around priorities, resources, and changes to standards  

Well-defined governance ensures that HRL’s annual and triennial synthesis products are generated collaboratively and are scientifically defensible, reproducible, and comparable across years, tributaries, and agencies.

## Governance Structure Overview

### Governance groups at a glance

- **Data Producers** generate and publish data.  
- **The Central Data Team** curates, standardizes, and serves data.  
- **Synthesis Teams** analyze curated data and generate synthesis products.  
- **The HRL Science Committee** provides program-level oversight and prioritization.

The HRL data governance framework is built around four interacting groups:

1. **Data Producers**  
2. **The Central Data Team**  
3. **Synthesis Teams**  
4. **The HRL Science Committee**

Each group plays a distinct role in guiding data from collection to static publication, ingestion, storage, analysis, synthesis, and reporting and communication, with clearly defined decision authorities and responsibilities.

The figure below illustrates how these roles interact across the HRL data lifecycle. **The HRL Science Committee plays an oversight role for the entire data lifecycle but does not directly implement any phase of the data lifecycle.**

# Roles and Responsibilities

## Data Producers

::: callout-tip
### Data Producers at a glance

- **Primary domain:** field, lab, and model-based data collection  
- **Key outputs:** quality-controlled and published datasets and metadata
- **Data lifecycle focus:** collection, static publication
:::

**Who they are**

System governance entities, HRL signatories, consultants, and partner organizations responsible for creating original data under the HRL program.

**Core responsibilities**

- Collect or generate raw data using standardized protocols approved by the HRL Science Committee through system science plan review
- Capture complete metadata at the point of collection  
- Apply quality management (QA/QC) practices
- Prepare and publish static datasets and metadata in trusted HRL program repositories (e.g., EDI) using reproducible code hosted under the HRL GitHub organization
- Notify the Central Data Team of new data publications and updates  

**Data lifecycle phases**

- [Collection](../lifecycle/collection.qmd)
- [Static publication](../lifecycle/static-publication.qmd)

**Decision authority**

- Select data collection methods within agreed-upon protocols  
- Determine timing of dataset release within governance rules (typically within one year of data collection)

## Central Data Team

::: callout-tip
### Central Data Team at a glance

- **Primary domain:** data engineering, architecture, and shared analysis and visualization tools  
- **Key outputs:** curated datasets, data catalogs, APIs, software development kits (SDKs), dashboards, decision support tools, and standards  
- **Lifecycle focus:** ingestion and standardization, storage and serving, analysis and synthesis (support), reporting and communication
:::

**Who they are**

Interagency technical experts (data engineers and data scientists) who design and operate the program’s shared data, analysis, and technology infrastructure.

**Core responsibilities**

- Develop and maintain the central data and technology architecture  
- Maintain the HRL Style and Development Guide and program-wide coding standards  
- Ingest, harmonize, and standardize datasets (ETL/ELT), including HRL-produced and relevant external datasets  
- Maintain databases, catalogs, APIs, and SDKs for accessing HRL data  
- Provide documentation, tools, dashboards, and automated reporting  
- Guide policies and implementations for sensitive data management, including CARE-aligned practices for Tribal data  
- Support synthesis teams with modeling infrastructure, workflows, and technical assistance  
- Facilitate feedback cycles across HRL parties to improve data quality, usability, and documentation  

**Lifecycle phases**

# How These Roles Work Together

Across the data lifecycle, governance mechanisms and data product quality gates ensure that:

- Every dataset has clear provenance, from field collection and static publication to curated HRL datasets and synthesis products  
- Every dataset and analysis is traceable, citable, and reproducible  
- Data can be harmonized and compared across systems, habitat types, and years  
- Synthesis teams have timely, reliable access to analysis-ready data and tools  
- The HRL Science Program learns and adapts based on documented feedback and evaluation  

Together, these roles and structures provide the foundation for evidence-based decision-making, adaptive management, long-term data infrastructure stewardship, and transparent public reporting on HRL’s ecological outcomes.
